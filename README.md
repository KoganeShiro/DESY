# DESY

DESY is a collaborative project involving students from Esadhar School and 42, as part of the Normandy Impressionism Festival.

In this project, we aim to create a unique and immersive synesthetic experience. Synesthesia is a perceptual phenomenon where stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to involuntary experiences in another. In our case, we're combining the visual and auditory senses.

As participants engage with the project, the live deformation of the image is directly influenced by the surrounding sound environment. The audio elements contribute to the transformation and distortion of the visual components in real-time. This dynamic interaction between sound and image creates a multisensory encounter, offering a fresh perspective on the connection between different forms of artistic expression.

The integration of live sound manipulation adds an extra layer of interactivity, making each encounter with the project a unique and evolving experience. The goal is to explore the boundaries between visual and auditory stimuli, providing participants with a captivating and innovative journey into the realm of synesthetic perception.
