In this project, we aim to create a unique and immersive synesthetic experience.

Synesthesia is a perceptual phenomenon where stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to involuntary experiences in another. In our case, we're combining the visual and auditory senses.

As participants engage with the project on their phone or any device that has a search engine.
They will see a live deformation of the image directly influenced by their surrounding sound environment. (The audio elements contribute to the transform and distortion of the visual components in real-time.)

The goal is to explore the boundaries between visual and auditory stimuli, providing participants with a new and innovative way to see their surrounding.
